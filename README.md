# Facerecoginition
Face recognition using a webcam using TensorFlow and OpenCV. Using deep neural networks, the application looks for faces in webcam photographs and compares them to pictures in an ID folder.
# Inspiration
You may find models, training code, and inspiration in the facenet repository. For facial and landmark detection, multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks are used, and an Inception Resnet is used for ID classification. Here is a direct access to the pretrained Inception Resnet model.
# How to 
set up your id folder and get the model from Facenet. Each subdirectory in the id folder needs to have at least one image of a single person. Since the folder's name is utilized as output, the subfolders ought to be given names of the individuals in the folder.
